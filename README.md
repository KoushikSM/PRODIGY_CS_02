Introduction:

Image encryption is a vital aspect of information security, especially when dealing with sensitive visual data. This Python program provides a simple yet effective solution for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. By altering the pixel values in an image, the program ensures that the original content remains concealed from unauthorized access.

Project Overview:

This Python program offers a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting images, allowing users to safeguard their visual data with ease. By manipulating pixel values through operations such as swapping or applying basic mathematical transformations, the program ensures that the encrypted image remains unintelligible to anyone without the decryption key.

Features:

Encryption: Users can input an image file and specify encryption parameters to transform the pixel values and generate an encrypted version of the image.
Decryption: Users can input the encrypted image file along with the decryption key to reverse the encryption process and recover the original image.
Pixel Manipulation: The program offers various pixel manipulation techniques such as swapping pixel values or applying mathematical operations to obscure the image content effectively.
Support for Different Image Formats: The program supports common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images regardless of their file type.
Intuitive User Interface: The program provides clear instructions and prompts to guide users through the encryption and decryption process, making it accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.
By leveraging the power of pixel manipulation techniques, this Python program empowers users to protect their visual data from unauthorized access, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of their images. Additionally, the program serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental concepts of image encryption and cybersecurity.
